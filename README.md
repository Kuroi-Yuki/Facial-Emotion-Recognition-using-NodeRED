# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-NodeRED
This repository aims to introduce NodeRED and  provide the reader the starting points through which he/she can build an application that utilizes a Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) api and NodeRED. This was inspired from the application "LOOK AT ME" that is aimed at Autistic children. LOOK AT ME app gamifies interactions, helping users learn to read moods, remember faces, and express themselves with facial expressions and poses. Children with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have major difficulties in recognizing and responding to emotional and mental states in others' facial expressions. Such difficulties in empathy underlie their social-communication difficulties that form a core of the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781897/).
